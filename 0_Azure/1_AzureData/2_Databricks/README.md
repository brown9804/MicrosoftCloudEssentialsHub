### **Key Features**
Here are some of the key features of Azure Databricks:

| **Feature**            | **Description**                                                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Processing**    | Efficiently process large volumes of data using Apache Spark.                   |
| **Machine Learning**   | Build, train, and deploy machine learning models at scale.                      |
| **Real-Time Analytics**| Perform real-time data analysis and generate insights quickly.                  |
| **Collaborative Workspace** | Provides a collaborative environment for different roles to work together. |
| **Scalability**        | Automatically scales resources to handle varying workloads.                     |
| **Integration**        | Seamlessly integrates with other Azure services and open-source tools.          |

This diagram shows how Azure Databricks integrates with various data sources and storage solutions, processes data using Apache Spark, and supports machine learning and real-time analytics.

## Architecture and Components

Azure Databricks architecture is divided into two main components: 

| **Component**            | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Control Plane**        | Manages backend services, authentication, job scheduling, and cluster management. Hosts the web application and REST APIs. |
| **Compute Plane**        | Where data processing happens, consisting of clusters running Apache Spark jobs. |

There are two types of compute planes:

| **Type of Compute Plane**            | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Serverless Compute**   | Managed by Azure Databricks, with automatic scaling and resource management. Ideal for users preferring a hands-off approach. |
| **Classic Compute**      | Managed by the user, with full control over compute resources within their Azure subscription. Allows for more customization and manual scaling. |

This diagram below shows how the control plane interacts with both the serverless and classic compute planes.
