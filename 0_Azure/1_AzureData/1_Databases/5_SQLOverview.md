## Overview

| Topic                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Fault Tolerance**          | Azure SQL Database ensures fault tolerance through various redundancy options at physical, server, and database levels. SQL Database Hyperscale separates compute and storage layers for increased redundancy. Azure's infrastructure can handle hardware failures by moving virtual machines to other physical nodes. |
| **High Availability**        | Achieved through local and zone redundancy, allowing quick recovery from failures and minimal downtime. Supports active geo-replication and failover groups to enhance availability.                                                              |
| **Disaster Recovery**        | Provides automated backups, geo-redundant storage, and active geo-replication to ensure data protection and quick restoration in the event of a regional outage.                                                                                   |
| **Authentication and Authorization** | Supports both SQL authentication and Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) authentication for secure and centralized management of user identities and permissions. Entra ID enables multifactor authentication and conditional access controls. |

          | Topic                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
          |------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
          | **Availability of Services** | Not all Azure services and features are available in every region. It's important to check the [Azure Products by Region page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/) to see which services are available in your desired region.                     |
          | **Redundancy Options**       | Azure SQL Database supports local and zonal redundancy options. Local redundancy provides resiliency within a datacenter, while zonal redundancy improves resiliency by protecting against outages of an availability zone within a region. |
          | **Compliance and Data Residency** | Different regions have specific compliance and data residency requirements. Azure regions are designed to meet these requirements, ensuring that your data stays within the specified geographic boundaries. |
          | **Virtual Network Rules**    | For SQL Database, virtual network rules must reference subnets hosted in the same geographic region as the database. Each server can have up to 128 ACL entries for any virtual network.                     |
          | **Authentication Methods**   | - **SQL Authentication**: Users connect using a username and password. <br/> - **Microsoft Entra Authentication**: Users authenticate using their Microsoft Entra ID credentials, which supports enhanced security features like multifactor authentication and conditional access policies. |
          | **Microsoft Entra Admin**    | The Microsoft Entra admin center is a unified portal for managing Microsoft Entra products, including identity and access management solutions. It provides tools for user and group management, device management, application management, security and compliance, and identity governance. This centralized interface helps streamline administrative tasks and enhances security. |

   - Choose the pricing tier and performance level that suits your needs.

      | Topic                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
      |--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | **SQL Elastic Pool**           | SQL Elastic Pools are a cost-effective solution for managing and scaling multiple databases with varying and unpredictable usage demands. Databases in an elastic pool share a set number of resources on a single server, allowing for efficient resource utilization and cost savings. |
      | **Benefits of SQL Elastic Pool** | - **Cost Efficiency**: Aggregate resources in an elastic pool to leverage economies of scale. <br> - **Flexibility**: Databases within a pool can auto-scale within the limits of the pool. <br> - **Simplified Management**: Manage a group of databases as a single entity, reducing administrative overhead. |
      | **Workload Environment Differences** | - **Development**: Environment where developers write and test code. It's a sandbox for experimentation and initial testing. <br> - **Production**: Live environment where the final code is deployed for end-users. It must be stable and reliable. <br> - **Key Differences from Azure Perspective**: <br> - **Development**: Typically uses lower-cost, lower-performance configurations. Suitable for testing and development purposes. <br> - **Production**: Uses higher-cost, higher-performance configurations. Optimized for reliability, performance, and security. |
      | **Backup Storage Redundancy**  | - **Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)**: Replicates data three times within a single physical location in the primary region. <br> - **Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS)**: Replicates data synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region. <br> - **Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)**: Replicates data asynchronously to a secondary region, providing high durability across regions. |

         | **Disaster Recovery** | Options for high availability and disaster recovery. This determines how your data is replicated and protected. | - **Primary or Geo Replica**: Main instance or a secondary instance in a different region for disaster recovery. <br> - **Standby Replica**: A secondary instance that can take over in case the primary instance fails. |
      
2. **Configure Networking**:
   - Set up firewall rules to allow access to your SQL Server.
   - Choose the appropriate network settings based on your security requirements.
