# AI Search 

> Built-in indexers are available for `Azure Cosmos DB, Azure SQL Database, Azure Blob Storage, and Microsoft SQL Server hosted in Azure Virtual Machines`. Use Azure `Data Factory`, with more than 80 connectors, or `Azure Logic Apps` to connect to your data source. Alternatively, push data into an Azure AI Search index, which has no restrictions on data source type.

## Examples of Use Cases 

> [!NOTE]
> Use Cases for Azure AI Search:

### E-commerce and Retail - Azure AI Search:
[return to Content](#content)

   - Enhance product search experiences on e-commerce websites by providing relevant results, filters, and facets.
   - Implement personalized recommendations based on user behavior and preferences.
   - Enable faceted navigation for efficient product discovery.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Here's an general architecture example of how Azure AI Search can be used in an e-commerce solution: <br/>

> Azure AI Search is an AI-powered information retrieval platform that helps developers build rich search experiences and generative AI apps that combine large language models with enterprise data. It can implement search functionality for any mobile or search application within your organization or as part of software as a service (SaaS) apps. <br/>

> 1. **Customers** go to the e-commerce web application from any device. <br/>
> 2. The **product catalog** is maintained in an **Azure SQL database** for transactional processing. <br/>
> 3. **Azure AI Search** uses a search indexer to automatically keep its search index up to date through integrated change tracking. <br/>
> 4. Customer's search queries are offloaded to the AI Search service, which processes the query and returns the most relevant results. <br/>
> 5. As an alternative to a web-based search experience, customers can also use a conversational bot in social media or straight from digital assistants to search for products and incrementally refine their search query and results. <br/>
> 6. Optionally, customers can use the skillset feature to apply artificial intelligence for even smarter processing. <br/>

> Key Azure services involved in this architecture include: <br/>
> - **Azure App Service - Web Apps**: Hosts web applications allowing autoscale and high availability without having to manage infrastructure. <br/>
> - **Azure SQL Database**: A general-purpose relational database-managed service in Microsoft Azure that supports structures such as relational data, JSON, spatial, and XML. <br/>
> - **Azure AI Search**: A cloud solution that provides a rich search experience over private, heterogeneous content in web, mobile, and enterprise applications. <br/>
> - **Azure AI Bot Service**: Provides tools to build, test, deploy, and manage intelligent bots. <br/>
> - **Azure AI services**: Lets you use intelligent algorithms to see, hear, speak, understand, and interpret your user needs through natural methods of communication. <br/>

### Content and Document Management - Azure AI Search:
[return to Content](#content)

   - Index and search through large document repositories, intranets, and knowledge bases.
   - Implement full-text search, highlighting, and document previews.
   - Facilitate content discovery and retrieval for employees and customers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> An example of **Use Case: Employee Knowledge Base Search**  <br/>

> **Scenario:** A multinational corporation has a vast internal knowledge base for its employees. This knowledge base includes a variety of documents such as policy documents, training materials, project reports, and more. The company wants to make it easier for employees to find relevant information quickly and efficiently. <br/>

> **Solution with Azure AI Search:** <br/>
> 1. **Azure Blob Storage:** All the documents are stored in Azure Blob Storage. This provides a scalable and secure place for storing all the company's documents. <br/>
> 2. **Azure AI Search:** This is the core service that enables the search functionality. It creates an index of all the documents stored in the Blob Storage. <br/>
> 3. **AI Enrichment:** Azure AI Search uses built-in AI capabilities to extract more insights from the documents. It can extract key phrases, recognize entities, and more. This enriched data is also stored in the search index. <br/>
> 4. **Search Application:** The company builds a search application that uses the Azure AI Search service. Employees can use this application to search the knowledge base. They can perform full-text search, get highlighted results, and even see document previews. <br/>
> 5. **Azure Active Directory:** To ensure secure access to the documents, the search application integrates with Azure Active Directory. This way, only authorized employees can search and view the documents. <br/>
> 6. **Azure Monitor and Azure Application Insights:** These services are used to monitor the performance of the search application and to get insights about its usage. This helps the company to continuously improve the search experience for its employees. <br/>

> This setup allows the company to facilitate content discovery and retrieval for its employees, enhancing productivity and efficiency. It's a great example of how Azure AI Search can be used in the context of content and document management. <br/>

In this diagram:

- The **Multinational Corporation** is divided into **Employees** and **Azure Services**.
- **Azure Blob Storage** stores all the company’s documents.
- **Azure AI Search** creates an index of all the documents stored in the Blob Storage.
- **AI Enrichment** uses built-in AI capabilities to extract more insights from the documents.
- **Search Application** is built by the company and uses the Azure AI Search service. Employees use this application to search the knowledge base.
- **Azure Active Directory** ensures secure access to the documents, so only authorized employees can search and view the documents.
- **Azure Monitor** and **Azure Application Insights** are used to monitor the performance of the search application and to get insights about its usage.

### Enterprise Search - Azure AI Search:
[return to Content](#content)

   - Create a unified search experience across various enterprise data sources (files, databases, APIs).
   - Enable users to find information quickly within their organization.
   - Support natural language queries and relevance tuning.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  An example of how you can create a unified search experience across various enterprise data sources using Azure resources and Azure AI Search.

> 1. **Data Ingestion**: The first step is to ingest data from various sources. Azure provides several connectors for popular data sources such as Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Blob Storage, and more. You can also use Azure Functions or Logic Apps to pull data from APIs and other sources not directly supported by Azure AI Search.
```python
# Example of using Azure Function to pull data from an API
import requests
import azure.functions as func

def main(mytimer: func.TimerRequest) -> None:
    response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
    data = response.json()
    # Code to push data to Azure AI Search
```
> 2. **Indexing**: Once the data is ingested, it needs to be indexed. Azure AI Search provides powerful capabilities to define custom indexes.
```json
// Example of creating an index in Azure AI Search 
{
  "name": "my-index",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "id", "type": "Edm.String", "key": true},
    {"name": "description", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true},
    // Other fields...
  ]
}
```
> 3. **Search**: With the data indexed, you can now implement the search experience. Azure AI Search provides a robust REST API and SDKs for popular programming languages.
```python
# Example of using the Python SDK to search
from azure.search.documents import SearchClient

client = SearchClient("<endpoint>", "<index name>", "<api key>")
results = client.search(search_text="example query")
```
> 4. **User Interface**: Finally, you need a user interface for users to interact with. This could be a web application, a mobile app, or even a chatbot. The UI sends queries to Azure AI Search and displays the results. <br/> 
> This is a simplified example, and a real-world implementation would likely involve additional considerations such as security, scalability, and performance optimization.
