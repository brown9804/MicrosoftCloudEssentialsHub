## Example of Use Cases

> [!NOTE]
> Here are some use cases:

### Customer Service - Bot Services:
[return to Content](#content)

- **Automated Support**: Azure Bot Services can be used to create chatbots that provide automated responses to common customer inquiries, reducing the workload on human customer service representatives.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Here’s an example of an end-to-end solution using Azure resources and Azure Bot Services: Please note that this is a very basic example and a real-world bot would likely be much more complex. You might use the Azure Bot Framework SDK for more advanced features, and you might integrate your bot with a natural language processing (NLP) service like LUIS (Language Understanding Intelligent Service) to better understand user inquiries. You might also integrate your bot with a database to store and retrieve information, and you might use Azure’s QnA Maker service to easily handle frequently asked questions. Finally, you would likely want to add authentication and error handling to your bot.

> Step 1: Create a Bot Service on Azure
> 
> - Navigate to the Azure portal and create a new Bot Service resource.
> - Choose a name, subscription, resource group, and location for your bot.
> - Select the F0 (free) pricing tier for testing purposes.
> 
> Step 2: Configure the Bot Service
> 
> - Once the Bot Service is deployed, go to the resource and navigate to the "Bot Management" section.
> - Click on "Channels" and enable the "Web Chat" channel. This will allow you to embed the bot on a website.
> - Navigate to "Settings" and configure the messaging endpoint, which will be used to handle messages from users.
> 
> Step 3: Develop the Bot
> 
> - You can develop the bot directly in the Azure portal using the online code editor, or you can download the bot's source code and develop it locally.
> - The bot's logic will be implemented in a file called `index.js` (for JavaScript bots) or `echoBot.cs` (for C# bots).
> - Implement the logic to handle common customer inquiries. For example, you could use a switch statement to handle different types of inquiries.
> 
> Here's a simple example of what the bot's logic might look like in JavaScript:
> 
> ```javascript
> module.exports = function(context, req) {
>     context.log('JavaScript HTTP trigger function processed a request.');
> 
>     const inquiry = (req.query.inquiry || (req.body && req.body.inquiry));
>     let response;
> 
>     switch(inquiry) {
>         case 'hours':
>             response = 'Our hours are 9am-5pm, Monday-Friday.';
>             break;
>         case 'location':
>             response = 'We are located at 123 Main St.';
>             break;
>         default:
>             response = 'Sorry, I did not understand your inquiry.';
>     }
> 
>     context.res = {
>         // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
>         body: response
>     };
> }
> ```
> Step 4: Test the Bot
> - After implementing the bot’s logic, you can test the bot directly in the Azure portal using the “Test in Web Chat” feature.
> Step 5: Deploy the Bot
> - If you developed the bot locally, you’ll need to deploy the bot to Azure. You can do this using the Azure CLI or the Azure portal.
> - After deploying the bot, you can embed it on your website using the embed code provided in the “Channels” section of the Bot Service resource.
