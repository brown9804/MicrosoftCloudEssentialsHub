| Policy Creation and Enforcement   | Allows creation and enforcement of DLP policies across various services.        |
| Machine Learning Integration      | Enhances detection accuracy with machine learning algorithms.                   |
| Comprehensive Monitoring          | Monitors actions on sensitive items and prevents unintentional sharing.         |
| Integration with Sensitivity Labels| Unifies data security and compliance with sensitivity labels from Microsoft Information Protection. |

## Limitation & Workarounds 

| **Limitation**                   | **Description**                                                                 | **Workaround**                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Policy and Rule Limits           | Constraints on the number of policies and rules you can create. For instance, the maximum number of DLP rules in a tenant is 600, and the maximum size of an individual DLP rule is 100 KB. | - **Prioritize Critical Policies**: Focus on creating policies that address the most critical data protection needs first. <br/> - **Combine Rules**: Where possible, combine multiple conditions into a single rule to stay within the limits. |
| File Type Restrictions           | DLP policies are primarily effective for specific file types, mainly Office files. This can limit the scope of protection for other file formats. | - **Custom Connectors**: Use custom connectors to extend DLP capabilities to other file types and applications. <br/> - **Third-Party Tools**: Integrate third-party DLP solutions that support a broader range of file types. |
| Text Extraction Limits           | The maximum size of text that can be extracted from a file for scanning is 2 MB. | - **Pre-Processing**: Pre-process files to reduce their size before they are scanned by DLP policies. <br/> - **Selective Scanning**: Focus on scanning the most critical parts of documents, such as headers, footers, and specific sections. |
| Policy Size and Complexity       | The maximum size of a DLP policy is 100 KB, which can limit the complexity and number of rules within a single policy. | - **Modular Policies**: Break down complex policies into smaller, modular policies that can be managed more easily. <br/> - **Regular Reviews**: Regularly review and optimize policies to ensure they remain within size limits. |
| Integration Limitations          | The data map in Microsoft Purview does not currently support DLP capabilities for Microsoft 365 apps and services. | - **Manual Processes**: Implement manual processes to complement DLP policies where integration is not supported. <br/> - **Custom Scripts**: Use custom scripts to automate data protection tasks that are not covered by DLP policies. |
| License Restrictions             | Some advanced DLP features are only available with higher-tier licenses, such as Office 365 E5. | - **Evaluate Needs**: Assess your organization's specific needs to determine if higher-tier licenses are necessary. <br/> - **Leverage Available Features**: Make the most of the features available in your current license tier while planning for future upgrades if needed. |

## Boundaries of DLP without Microsoft Purview

> Data Loss Prevention (DLP) without Microsoft Purview can still be effective, but it has some limitations compared to the comprehensive features offered by Purview.

| Limitation                | Description                                                                                     |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Limited Integration       | DLP solutions might not integrate as seamlessly with other Microsoft 365 services and third-party applications. |
| Reduced Coverage          | Limited support for non-Windows devices compared to Purview's extensive coverage across Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. |
| Policy Management         | More challenging to manage and enforce DLP policies without the centralized management capabilities provided by Purview. |
| Advanced Features         | Less robust features like Endpoint DLP and integration with non-Microsoft cloud apps.            |
| Compliance and Reporting  | Fewer advanced compliance and reporting tools to help meet regulatory requirements and monitor data usage effectively. |

## Custom Connectors

Find below some examples of custom connectors for Data Loss Prevention (DLP) in Azure Purview. These custom connectors `can be created and managed using the Power Platform admin center`, where you can classify them into different categories such as `Business, Non-Business, or Blocked`. `This classification helps in applying appropriate DLP policies` to ensure data protection across various environments.

1. **Custom API Connectors**:
   - **Example**: A custom connector to a proprietary HR system API to monitor and protect sensitive employee data.
   - **Usage**: This connector can be used to enforce DLP policies on data being transferred between the HR system and other applications.

2. **Third-Party Cloud Services**:
   - **Example**: A custom connector for a third-party cloud storage service like Box or Dropbox.
   - **Usage**: This allows DLP policies to monitor and control the flow of sensitive information to and from these services.

3. **Legacy Systems**:
   - **Example**: A custom connector to a legacy on-premises database.
   - **Usage**: Enables DLP policies to be applied to data being accessed or transferred from older systems that do not natively support modern DLP features.

4. **Custom File Processing Services**:
   - **Example**: A custom connector for a file processing service that converts documents to different formats.
   - **Usage**: Ensures that sensitive information is not inadvertently exposed during the conversion process.

5. **Custom Email Gateways**:
   - **Example**: A custom connector for an email gateway that handles outbound emails.
   - **Usage**: Applies DLP policies to monitor and prevent the leakage of sensitive information through email communications.
