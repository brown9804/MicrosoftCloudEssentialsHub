|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Map**        | - Automated Metadata Scanning: Automate the scanning of metadata from various data sources. <br> - Data Lineage: Track the lineage of data to understand its flow from source to destination. | - Use built-in and custom classifiers for accurate data discovery and classification. <br> - Ensure comprehensive lineage tracking for compliance and auditing. |
| **Data Catalog**    | - Governance Domains: Create governance domains to distribute ownership and maintenance tasks. <br> - Glossary Terms: Define glossary terms to standardize data definitions across the organization. | - Distribute governance responsibilities to make data easily discoverable. <br> - Standardize data definitions to enhance understanding and usage. |

### **Handling Data Subject Requests**

| **Component**               | **Description**                                                                 | **Best Practices**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Self-Service Access Requests** | - Access Workflow: Enable users to request access to data assets directly through the Purview catalog. <br> - Data Access Policies: Implement data access policies to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive data. | - Streamline access requests by automating workflows. <br> - Protect privacy and comply with regulations through strict access policies. |

### **Additional Best Practices**

| **Practice**                | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Federated Governance**    | Adopt a federated governance approach to distribute data governance responsibilities across the organization. |
| **Data Quality and Trust**  | Enhance data quality and trustworthiness by implementing governance-focused actions and creating source-of-truth data products. |
| **Business Value Creation** | Align data governance with business practices to unlock business value and make data more accessible and useful for decision-making. |

## Query an SQL database with Azure Purview

1. **Register the Data Source**:
   - Open the Microsoft Purview governance portal.
   - Register your Azure SQL Database as a data source. This involves providing the necessary credentials and permissions.
2. **Configure Access**: Ensure that the Purview managed identity has the required permissions on your SQL database. This typically involves creating a user in your SQL database and assigning the appropriate roles.
3. **Run a Scan**: In the Purview portal, create and run a scan on your registered SQL database. This will extract metadata and classify the data based on predefined or custom rules.
4. **Explore the Data**: Once the scan is complete, you can explore the data classifications, lineage, and other insights provided by Purview. This helps in understanding the structure and content of your data.
5. **Query the Data**: Use the query editor in the Azure portal to connect to your SQL database and run queries. Navigate to your SQL database in the Azure portal, select the query editor, and provide your credentials to start querying.

## How to remove data from Azure Purview

1. **Delete Individual Assets**:
   - Navigate to the asset you want to delete in the Purview portal.
   - Select the asset and click on the delete button. This will remove the asset and any child assets under its hierarchy. Find more information [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/catalog-asset-details).
2. **Bulk Delete Assets**: Currently, the Purview user interface does not support bulk deletion of assets directly. However, you can use REST APIs to delete multiple assets. You will need to get the GUIDs of the assets you want to delete and use the `DELETE` method with the appropriate endpoint. Find more information about it [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/805790/delete-multiple-assets-in-purview).
3. **Remove Data Source**: If you want to remove an entire data source, you can unregister it from the Purview portal. This will remove all associated metadata and classifications. Find more information [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/catalog-asset-details).
4. **Considerations**:
   - Ensure you have the necessary permissions to delete assets or data sources.
   - Be aware that deleting assets will also remove any associated metadata and lineage information.

## Restoring deleted information in Azure Purview 

| **Scenario**                | **Description**               |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------  |
| **Permanent Deletion**      | When you delete an asset using the delete button in Azure Purview, it is permanently deleted. This means that the asset and its metadata are removed from the catalog.  |
| **Reingestion**             | If the asset was ingested from a data source, you can run a full scan on that source again. This will reingest the asset into the Purview catalog, effectively restoring it.      |
| **Backup and Disaster Recovery** | Azure Purview does not currently support automated backup and disaster recovery (BCDR). However, you can manually create a secondary Purview account in another region to serve as a backup. This involves duplicating all activities performed on the primary account to the secondary account. |
| **Manual Restoration**      | For more complex scenarios, you might need to manually restore data using scripts or APIs. This requires maintaining a backup of your metadata and configurations.     |
