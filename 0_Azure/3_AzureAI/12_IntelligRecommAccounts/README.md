## Example of Use Cases

> [!NOTE]
> Here are some use cases:

### E-commerce Personalization - Intelligent Recommendations Accounts:
[return to Content](#content)

Azure Intelligent Recommendations can be used to provide personalized product recommendations to users based on their browsing and purchasing history. This can significantly improve the user experience and increase sales.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Here’s an example of an end-to-end solution using Azure resources and Azure Intelligent Recommendations Accounts: This solution leverages Azure Intelligent Recommendations to provide personalized product recommendations to users based on their browsing and purchasing history. This can significantly improve the user experience and increase sales.

> Architecture: The following Azure services are used in this solution
> - **Azure Intelligent Recommendations**: For generating personalized product recommendations.
> - **Azure Cosmos DB**: For storing user browsing and purchasing history.
> - **Azure Functions**: For processing user data and interacting with Azure Intelligent Recommendations.
> - **Azure App Service**: For hosting the e-commerce website.
> 
> Workflow
> 1. **User Browsing and Purchasing History**: User interactions with the e-commerce website are tracked and stored in Azure Cosmos DB.
> 2. **Data Processing**: An Azure Function is triggered on a regular basis (or in response to changes in the Cosmos DB) to process the user data and generate a batch of recommendation requests.
> 3. **Generate Recommendations**: The batch of recommendation requests is sent to Azure Intelligent Recommendations, which returns a set of personalized product recommendations for each user.
> 4. **Display Recommendations**: The product recommendations are displayed to the user on the e-commerce website hosted on Azure App Service.
> 
> Code Samples: Here are some code snippets to illustrate how these components might interact. Note that these are simplified examples and may need to be adapted for a real-world application.
> 
> - Storing User Data in Cosmos DB:
> 
> ```python
> # Python code for storing user data in Cosmos DB
> from azure.cosmos import CosmosClient
> 
> # Initialize Cosmos Client
> cosmos_client = CosmosClient("<Your Cosmos DB Connection String>")
> 
> # Select database
> database = cosmos_client.get_database_client("<Your Database Name>")
> 
> # Select container
> container = database.get_container_client("<Your Container Name>")
> 
> # Insert user data
> user_data = {"id": "1", "browsing_history": [...], "purchase_history": [...]}
> container.upsert_item(user_data)
> ```
> 
> - Generating Recommendations with Azure Intelligent Recommendations:
> ```python 
> # Python code for generating recommendations with Azure Intelligent Recommendations
> import requests
> 
> # Define the API endpoint
> api_endpoint = "https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/recommendations/v4.0/models/<Your Model Name>/recommend/item"
> 
> # Define the headers
> headers = {
>     "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key": "<Your Azure Intelligent Recommendations Key>",
>     "Content-Type": "application/json"
> }
> 
> # Define the payload
> payload = {
>     "itemIds": ["<Item ID 1>", "<Item ID 2>", ...],
>     "numberOfResults": 10,
>     "minimalScore": 0.0
> }
> 
> # Send the POST request
> response = requests.post(api_endpoint, headers=headers, json=payload)
> 
> # Print the recommendations
> print(response.json())
> ```
>

### Content Discovery - Intelligent Recommendations Accounts:
[return to Content](#content)

In media or news platforms, Azure Intelligent Recommendations can suggest articles, videos, or other content that might interest the user, enhancing user engagement and time spent on the platform.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Here’s an example of an end-to-end solution using Azure resources and Azure Intelligent Recommendations Accounts: This solution aims to enhance user engagement and time spent on media or news platforms by suggesting articles, videos, or other content that might interest the user.

> Architecture
> 1. **Data Ingestion**: Use **Azure Data Factory** to ingest data from various sources into Azure.
> 2. **Data Storage**: Store the ingested data in **Azure Blob Storage** for unstructured data (like videos, images) and **Azure Cosmos DB** for structured or semi-structured data (like user profiles, article metadata).
> 3. **Data Processing**: Use **Azure Databricks** to process and transform the data into a suitable format for the recommendation engine.
> 4. **Recommendation Engine**: Use **Azure Personalizer**, part of Azure Cognitive Services, to generate personalized recommendations based on the processed data.
> 5. **User Interface**: Display the recommended content to the user through a web or mobile application hosted on **Azure App Service**.
> 
> Implementation Steps
> 1. **Set up Azure Data Factory**: Create pipelines to ingest data from various sources into Azure.
> 2. **Set up Azure Blob Storage and Azure Cosmos DB**: Store the ingested data.
> 3. **Set up Azure Databricks**: Write Spark jobs to process and transform the data.
> 4. **Set up Azure Personalizer**: Train a model with the processed data to generate personalized recommendations.
> 5. **Set up Azure App Service**: Develop and deploy your web or mobile application.
