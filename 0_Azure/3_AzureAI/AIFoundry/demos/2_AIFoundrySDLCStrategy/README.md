1. **AI Hub**:
   - The AI Hub serves as the `central repository for all AI-related resources and activities`.
   - It provides a unified interface for managing AI models, deployments, and related services.
2. **Project-Based Structure**:
   - AI Foundry works by organizing resources into projects.
   - `Each project can contain multiple AI models, deployments, and configurations`.
   - Projects help in `segregating different AI initiatives, making it easier to manage and track progress`.
3. **Model Deployment**:
   - Users can choose from existing models for deployment, eliminating the need for manual uploads.
   - The platform supports deploying base models, fine-tuned models, and custom models.
   - Deployment configurations can be tailored to specific environments such as development, testing, and production.
4. **Management and Monitoring**:
   - AI Foundry provides tools for managing model versions, ensuring that updates and changes are tracked effectively.
   - Integrated monitoring and analytics help in tracking the performance and usage of deployed models.
5. **User Flexibility**:
   - The platform caters to both technical and non-technical users.
   - Technical users can leverage advanced features for model customization and fine-tuning.
   - Non-technical users can easily deploy and use pre-configured models through a user-friendly interface.

> Delivering your AI models via API, catering to different levels of flexibility for users.

| Approach                  | Description                                                                                       | Components                                                                                           |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Flexible Model Modification** | This approach allows customers to modify and fine-tune the AI models according to their specific needs. | 1. **AI Foundry**: Use AI Foundry to host and manage your AI models. This platform provides tools for customers to modify and fine-tune models.<br>2. **Azure API Management**: Expose the models as APIs, allowing customers to integrate them into their systems.<br>3. **Self-Service Portal**: Create a self-service portal where customers can access the models, make modifications, and deploy their customized versions.<br>4. **Monitoring and Analytics**: Use Azure Monitor and Application Insights to track usage, performance, and modifications made by customers. |
| **Ready-to-Use API**      | This approach provides customers with a ready-to-use API, requiring no modifications.              | 1. **AI Foundry**: Host the pre-trained models on AI Foundry.<br>2. **Azure API Management**: Expose these models as APIs, ensuring they are easy to integrate into customer systems.<br>3. **Documentation and Support**: Provide comprehensive documentation and support to help customers integrate the API into their systems without needing to modify the models.<br>4. **Monitoring and Analytics**: Use Azure Monitor and Application Insights to track API usage and performance. |

## Demo

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please perform all necessary tuning and evaluation as required. This serves as an end-to-end example of how to integrate AI into multiple services using two approaches: one that is more flexible for those familiar with model configuration and tuning, and another that provides ready-to-use APIs for users needing a secure API for their applications.

### Set Up Azure API Management

> **Azure API Management** will be used to expose your AI models as APIs. This allows your customers to integrate the AI models into their systems seamlessly. Here are the key roles it plays: <br/> 
> 1. **API Exposure**: It helps in creating and managing APIs for your AI models, making them accessible to your customers. <br/>
> 2. **Security**: It provides robust security features to protect your APIs, including authentication, authorization, and rate limiting. <br/>
> 3. **Scalability**: It ensures that your APIs can handle varying levels of traffic, scaling up or down as needed. <br/>
> 4. **Monitoring and Analytics**: It offers tools to monitor API usage, performance, and health, providing valuable insights for optimization. <br/>
> 5. **Documentation**: It allows you to create and publish comprehensive documentation for your APIs, helping customers understand how to use them effectively.

1. **Create API Management Service**:
   - Search for `API Management` in the Azure Marketplace.

       <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb0f913c-4926-4de0-83ff-f8bce064eb22" />

   - Click `Create` and fill in the required details (e.g., name, resource group).
   - Configure the settings and click `Review + create` and then `Create`.

       <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/475c29d2-d117-4c9e-8361-a559ff7319f9" />

2. **Expose AI Models as APIs**:
   - Navigate to your `API Management` instance.

       <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fb9d44b-9f00-4351-9548-4abdf8920e73" />

   - In the API Management instance, click on `APIs` in the left-hand menu.
   - **Define the API**:

       - **HTTP**: Choose this option if you want to expose your AI model as an HTTP API.
       - **WebSocket**: Select this for full-duplex communication over a single TCP connection.
       - **GraphQL**: Use this if you want to expose your API using GraphQL.
       - If you have an existing API definition, you can use options like `OpenAPI`, `WADL`, `WSDL`, or `GraphQL Schema` to import the API definition.

           <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8158db35-57fc-4746-bac4-48dcaa290710" />

           <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80ac17f7-0012-4b89-a3d2-8eb4fef90c29" />

   - Configure the endpoints and security settings.
