The token totals are calculated using the following equation:<br/><br/>$$\text{Total Tokens} = \text{Peak calls per minute} \times (\text{Tokens in prompt call} + \text{Tokens in model response})$$ <br/> Click [here for more explanation on how to calculate it](https://github.com/brown9804/MicrosoftCloudEssentialsHub/blob/main/0_Azure/3_AzureAI/9_AzureOpenAI/demos/4_PTUs_TPM.md#ptus-and-tpm-relationship)| - Hourly rate based on the number of PTUs deployed<br/>- Regardless of the number of tokens processed   | - Well-defined, predictable throughput requirements<br/>- Consistent traffic<br/>- Real-time or latency-sensitive applications<br/>- **Cost Predictability:** PTU offers more predictable costs compared to the pay-as-you-go model, which can vary based on usage.<br/>- **Performance Guarantees:** PTU provides guaranteed throughput and latency constraints, which can be beneficial for real-time or latency-sensitive applications. |

## Tokenization 

> Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units called tokens. In Azure OpenAI Service, tokenization is used to calculate the number of tokens processed, which directly impacts the cost. `Tokens are pieces of words`. When processing text, Azure OpenAI Service breaks down the input into tokens, which `can be as short as one character or as long as one word`.
> These tokens are used by the model to understand and generate text.

Process: 
1. **Text Splitting:** The input text is split into tokens, which can be as short as one character or as long as one word. This splitting is done using a method called **Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)**.
2. **Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE):** BPE is a tokenization method that merges the most frequently occurring pairs of characters into a single token. This approach is particularly effective in handling rare words and subwords, as it allows the model to break down complex or unseen words into more manageable pieces.
3. **Token Limits:** Each model in Azure OpenAI has a maximum token limit per request. It's important to be aware of these limits when designing your prompts and handling responses.
4. **Tokenization Example:** To illustrate, the word "hamburger" might be tokenized into ["ham", "bur", "ger"], while a common word like "pear" would remain as a single token ["pear"]. Many tokens also start with a whitespace, for example, " hello" and " bye".

| **Process**               | **Description**                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Input Tokenization**    | The input text is tokenized into individual tokens. For example, the sentence "Hello, world!" would be tokenized into `["Hello", ",", " world", "!"]`. |
| **Output Tokenization**   | The model’s response is also tokenized. For example, if the model generates the text "Hi there!", it might be tokenized into `["Hi", " there", "!"]`. |
| **Total Tokens Processed**| The total number of tokens processed is the sum of the input tokens and the output tokens.                                                        |
| **Cost Calculation**      | The cost is calculated based on the total number of tokens processed, using the pricing information provided by Azure.                            |


The cost for using Azure OpenAI can be calculated using the following general formula:

$$\text{Cost} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Tokens}}{N} \right) \times \text{Price per N Tokens}$$

Where:
- **Number of Tokens** is the total number of tokens processed (input tokens + output tokens).
- **N** is the number of tokens for which the price is specified (e.g., 100,000 tokens).
- **Price per N Tokens** is the cost rate for processing N tokens, which varies based on the model and region.

## Optimization: Best Practices Overview

| Optimization Aspect | Technical Details                                                                                     | Best Practices                                                                                       |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Input Optimization  | - **Token Efficiency:** Reducing the number of tokens in the input can significantly lower costs.<br/>- **Prompt Engineering:** Crafting prompts that achieve the desired result with fewer tokens.<br/>- **Context Management:** Including only the necessary context in the input to minimize token usage. | - **Concise Prompts:** Use the shortest possible prompts that still convey the necessary information.<br/>- **Avoid Redundancy:** Remove any repetitive or unnecessary words from the prompts.<br/>- **Template Design:** Design prompt templates that are efficient in terms of token usage. |
| Output Optimization | - **Response Length Control:** Limiting the length of the model's response can help manage and predict costs.<br/>- **Stop Sequences:** Using stop sequences to control where the model should stop generating further tokens.<br/>- **Max Tokens Parameter:** Setting an appropriate limit on the number of tokens in the response. | - **Set Max Tokens:** Use the `max_tokens` parameter to limit the length of the model's response.<br/>- **Use Stop Sequences:** Define stop sequences to control the verbosity of the output.<br/>- **Quality Check:** Regularly review the model's responses to ensure they are within the expected length and quality. |

 Authorization: Bearer {accessToken}
 ```

### Adding Filters

> [!NOTE]
> General API Call Structure: 
> Azure Cost Management APIs typically follow a RESTful structure. Here's a basic example of an API call to retrieve cost data:

```http
GET https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Consumption/usageDetails?api-version=2019-10-01
```

Key Components:  
1. **Base URL**: `https://management.azure.com/` 
2. **Scope**: This defines the level at which you want to retrieve cost data. It can be a subscription, resource group, or a specific resource. For example: 
    - Subscription: `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}` 
    - Resource Group: `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}` 
    - Resource: `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/{resourceProviderNamespace}/{resourceType}/{resourceName}` 
3. **Resource Path**: `/providers/Microsoft.Consumption/usageDetails` 
4. **API Version**: `api-version=2019-10-01` 

> Example API Call: <br/>
> To get usage details for a specific subscription, your API call might look like this:

```http
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Consumption/usageDetails?api-version=2019-10-01
```

You can add various filters to narrow down the data. Here’s a table of common filters:

| **Filter**         | **Description**                                      | **Example**                                                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Date Range         | Filter by a specific date range                      | `$filter=properties/usageStart ge '2023-01-01' and properties/usageEnd le '2023-01-31'` |

| Tag                | Filter by tag name and value                         | `$filter=tags/yourTagName eq 'yourTagValue'`                                 |
| Location           | Filter by resource location                          | `$filter=properties/location eq 'eastus'`                                   |
| Charge Type        | Filter by type of charge (e.g., usage, purchase)     | `$filter=properties/chargeType eq 'Usage'`                                   |
| Invoice ID         | Filter by specific invoice ID                        | `$filter=properties/invoiceId eq 'yourInvoiceId'`                            |

To ensure that API calls from different departments are tagged correctly, you can include the tags in the API requests. Here’s an example of how to do this:

- **Set Up the API Call**:
   - Use the Azure OpenAI API to make requests.
   - Include the tags in the request headers or body as needed.

  ```shell
  curl --request POST \
    --url 'https://azureopenaibrowntest.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/gpt-4/chat/completions?api-version=2024-08-01-preview' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'api-key: {key_value}' \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --data '{
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "max_tokens": 200,
    "seed": 42,
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Tell me a story about how the universe?"
      }
    ]
  }'
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> To tag usage costs from different departments or areas, you can use the `user` parameter in your API requests. This parameter allows you to assign a unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help monitor and detect usage patterns across different departments

### Generating Billing Reports Based on Tags

1. **Navigate to Cost Management + Billing**: In the Azure portal, go to **Cost Management + Billing**.
2. **Cost Analysis**:
   - Select **Cost Analysis**.
   - Use the **Add filter** option to filter costs by tags.
   - For example, filter by `department-hr` to see the costs associated with the Marketing department.
3. **Group by Tags**:
   - Use the **Group by** option to group costs by tags.
   - This will allow you to see a breakdown of costs by tags.

### Automating Tagging with Azure Policy

> To ensure that all resources are tagged consistently, you can use Azure Policy to enforce tagging.

1. **Create a Tagging Policy**:
   - Go to **Azure Policy** in the Azure portal.
   - Click on **Definitions** and then **+ Policy definition**.
   - Create a policy definition that requires tags on resources.
2. **Assign the Policy**:
   - Assign the policy to the subscription or resource group.
   - This will ensure that all new resources are tagged according to the policy.
