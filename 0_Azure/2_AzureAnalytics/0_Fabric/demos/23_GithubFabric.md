## Connect a workspace to a Git repo

> Only a workspace admin has the capability to connect a workspace to a repository. However, once the connection is established, anyone with the appropriate permission can work within the workspace. If you are not an admin, please request assistance from your admin to connect. To link a workspace to an Azure or GitHub repository, [follow these steps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/cicd/git-integration/git-get-started?tabs=azure-devops%2CAzure%2Ccommit-to-git#connect-a-workspace-to-a-git-repo).

## Connecting to a workspace (Already linked to GitHub)

> [For detailed instructions, please click here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/cicd/git-integration/git-get-started?tabs=azure-devops%2CAzure%2Ccommit-to-git#connect-to-a-workspace). If the workspace is already integrated with GitHub, please refer to the instructions for [Connecting to a shared workspace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/cicd/git-integration/git-integration-process?tabs=Azure%2Cazure-devops#connect-to-a-shared-workspace).

## Commit changes to git

> [See detailed instructions here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/cicd/git-integration/git-get-started?tabs=azure-devops%2CAzure%2Ccommit-to-git#commit-changes-to-git). After connecting to a Git folder, proceed to edit your workspace as normal. Saved changes will be stored in the workspace only. When ready, you may commit your changes to the Git branch or revert to the previous state. For more information, refer to [commits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/cicd/git-integration/git-integration-process?tabs=Azure%2Cazure-devops#commit).

## Update workspace from Git

> [Check out detailed instructions here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/cicd/git-integration/git-get-started?tabs=azure-devops%2CAzure%2Ccommit-to-git#update-workspace-from-git). When a new change is committed to the connected Git branch, a notification will appear in the relevant workspace. Please use the Source control panel to pull the latest changes, merges, or reverts into the workspace and update live items. For further details, refer to [updating](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/cicd/git-integration/git-integration-process?tabs=Azure%2Cazure-devops#update).

## Disconnect a workspace from Git

> Only a workspace admin has the authority to disconnect a workspace from a Git Repo. If you are not an admin, please contact your admin for assistance with disconnecting. If you are an admin and wish to disconnect your repo.
