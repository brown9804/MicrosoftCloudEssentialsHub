> Each license level provides different amounts of computational power and features, allowing organizations to choose the one that best fits their needs <br/> <br/>
> `Pay-as-you-go` capacities related with specific Azure `resource groups`. This allows you to manage and allocate resources within your organizational structure more effectively. <br/> 
> `Reservation` capacities are managed at the `subscription level`. This means you can’t directly associate them with individual resource groups. Instead, they apply to the entire subscription, providing a discount for committing to a certain amount of capacity over a period of time.
> Assign the capacity to your workspace

> [!NOTE]
> The total cost of the reservation is distributed over the reservation period. This means you don't have to pay the entire amount upfront; instead, the cost is spread out, making it easier to manage and predict your expenses.

> Example: By choosing an F128 reservation in Microsoft Fabric, if the pay-as-you-go rate is $23.04 per hour, with the reservation, you might pay $13.706 per hour, saving ~41%.

Overall process:

> 1. Make a `reservation`, click to see [how to make a reservation](#how-to-make-a-reservation).
> 2. After making a reservation, you need to create the actual `Fabric capacity` where your workloads will run. Link the capacity to your reservation during this setup. Click to see [how to create and link fabric capacity with reservation](#creatinglinking-fabric-capacity-to-your-reservation).
> 3. Assign the workspace capacity, click [here](#assign-workspace-capacity) to see more.

## Reservations & Capacity

> Microsoft Fabric `Reservations are agreements` for a specific time period and compute capacity. Whether using the Pay-as-you-go model or reservations, you need to create the Microsoft Fabric Capacity within a resource group. <br/> <br/>
> Reservations in Azure, including Microsoft Fabric `reservations`, are `managed at the subscription level`. This means that the reserved capacity units (CUs) apply to the entire subscription, not to individual resource groups. <br/>
> - `Reservations`: Provide a `subscription-wide discount` for committing to a certain amount of capacity over a period of time. <br/>
> - `Capacity Creation`: You create and manage Fabric `capacities within specific resource groups`, but the `cost benefits from the reservation apply at the subscription level`. 

> While manage resources within resource groups, the reservation’s cost benefits are applied across the entire subscription.

| **Aspect** | **Details** |
|------------|-------------|
| **Reservation** | - `Subscription Level Management`: When you make a reservation, it applies to the entire subscription. This means any resource within that subscription can benefit from the reserved capacity.<br/>- `Discounts`: The primary benefit of reservations is the cost savings. By committing to a certain amount of capacity over a period of time, you receive a discount compared to pay-as-you-go pricing.<br/>- `Flexibility`: While the reservation itself is at the subscription level, you can still create and manage individual capacities within different resource groups. The reserved capacity units are utilized by any eligible resources within the subscription. |
| **Capacity** | - `Creating Capacity`: Even though the reservation is at the subscription level, you still need to create the actual Fabric capacity in the Azure portal. This capacity can be assigned to specific resource groups as needed.<br/>- `Utilizing Reservations`: When you create a Fabric capacity, it will automatically utilize the reserved capacity units from your subscription, ensuring you benefit from the cost savings. |

### Scope Assignment in Reservations

| **Level**                | **Scope**                                                                                                                                       | **Usage/Management**                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Subscription Level**   | - Reservations are applied at the subscription level.<br/>- Reserved capacity units (CUs) provide a discount for any eligible resources within the entire subscription. | Any Fabric capacity created within this subscription can utilize the reserved CUs, benefiting from the cost savings. |
| **Resource Group Level** | - Reservations are managed at the subscription level.<br/>- The reserved capacity units are not directly assigned to individual resource groups but are available for any resource within the subscription.  | You can still organize and manage your resources within different resource groups. |
