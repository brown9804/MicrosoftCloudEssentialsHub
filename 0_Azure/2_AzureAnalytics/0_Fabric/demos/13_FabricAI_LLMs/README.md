> [!NOTE]
> Click [here](https://github.com/brown9804/MicrosoftCloudEssentialsHub/blob/main/0_Azure/2_AzureAnalytics/0_Fabric/demos/13_FabricAI_LLMs/src/fabric-llms-overview_sample.ipynb) to see all notebook

1. **Set Up API Keys**: Ensure you have the API key and endpoint URL for your deployed model. Set these as environment variables

<img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2eb24bf-7279-4f4e-be00-408dbbd82600">

 ```python
import os

# Set the API version for the Azure OpenAI service
os.environ["OPENAI_API_VERSION"] = "2023-08-01-preview"

# Set the base URL for the Azure OpenAI service
os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"] = "https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com"

# Set the API key for Azure OpenAI
os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"
 ```

2. **Initialize Azure OpenAI Class**: Create an instance of the Azure OpenAI class using the environment variables set above.

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9fad52c-5c64-4047-8f22-cef80ce33d6e">

     ```python
    from langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAI
    
    # Set the API base URL
    api_base = os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"]
    
    # Create an instance of the Azure OpenAI Class
    llm = AzureChatOpenAI(
        openai_api_key=os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"],
        temperature=0.7,
        verbose=True,
        top_p=0.9
    )
     ```

3. **Call the Deployed Model**: Use the Azure OpenAI service to generate text or perform other language model tasks. Here's an example of generating a response based on a prompt

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6cfccfe-42b6-45f6-9d84-6189c1222f92">

     ```python
    # Define a prompt
    messages = [
        (
            "system",
            "You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French. Translate the user sentence.",
        ),
        ("human", "Hi, how are you?"),
    ]
    
    # Generate a response from the Azure OpenAI service using the invoke method
    ai_msg = llm.invoke(messages)
    
    # Print the response
    print(ai_msg)
     ```

Make sure to replace `"your_openai_api_key"`, `"https://your_openai_api_base/"`, `"your_deployment_name"`, and `"your_model_name"` with your actual API key, base URL, deployment name, and model name from your Azure OpenAI instance.
