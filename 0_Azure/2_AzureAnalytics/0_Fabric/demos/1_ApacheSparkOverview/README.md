This collection of demos showcasing the powerful capabilities of Apache Spark within Microsoft Fabric. Apache Spark is a versatile open-source analytics engine designed for large-scale data processing, and Microsoft Fabric provides an integrated environment to leverage Spark’s full potential.

## Prerequisites

1. **Create a Workspace**:  Begin by setting up a workspace in Microsoft Fabric. This workspace will serve as the central hub for all your data analysis activities.
2. **Create a Lakehouse and Upload Files**:  Create a Lakehouse within your workspace. A Lakehouse combines the best features of data lakes and data warehouses, allowing you to store and manage large volumes of structured and unstructured data. Upload your data files to the Lakehouse to make them accessible for analysis.
3. **Create a Notebook**: Create a new notebook in your workspace. Notebooks are interactive documents that allow you to write and execute code, visualize data, and document your analysis process. In this notebook, we will use PySpark, the Python API for Spark, to perform our data analysis.
4. **Load Data into a DataFrame**: Load your data from the Lakehouse into a Spark DataFrame. DataFrames are distributed collections of data organized into named columns, making them ideal for data manipulation and analysis. We will use Spark's powerful data processing capabilities to clean, transform, and analyze the data.
