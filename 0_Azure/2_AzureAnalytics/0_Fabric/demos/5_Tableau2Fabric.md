## Data Modelling 

> The **Power BI** Data Modelling tab is where you can create relationships between your tables, appropriate relationships will automatically be detected, but you also have the flexibility to change the definition. This is very similar to the Relationships experience in **Tableau**.

### Data Modelling – Dataflows
> Dataflows in **Power BI** allows you to centralize your Extract, Transform, Load process, it is like building a **Tableau** flow, `but making it reusable and easily accessible to other users.` You build Dataflows on **Power BI Service** through a no code/low code Power Query experience. After your Dataflow is built, you can share it with other users so that they don’t have to go through all the data cleaning and transformation steps again, instead allow them to connect directly to the Dataflow.

### Data Modelling – Date Tables and Time Intelligence

>  Like **Tableau**, whenever you have a date field in **Power BI**, a Date hierarchy will automatically be created to allow drilling. It is recommended to create a separate date table with all dates from the earliest date in your data to the latest day, mark it as a date table, and then join all the date fields to the date table.

- **Creating a Date Table**: In Power BI, you can create a date table using DAX functions like `CALENDAR` or `CALENDARAUTO`. The `CALENDAR` function requires start and end dates, while `CALENDARAUTO` automatically generates a date range based on the data model.
- **Marking as Date Table**: Once the date table is created, you should mark it as a date table in Power BI. This ensures that time-intelligence functions work correctly.
- **Joining Date Fields**: After creating and marking the date table, join all date fields in your data model to this date table. This allows for consistent and accurate time-based analysis across different datasets.

> DAX provides many built-in time-intelligence and date functions, such as: Year to Date, Same Period Last Year, Total Year to Date (Quarter to Date, Month to Date). Whereas Tableau has only a few simple date calculation functions. These functions are essential for analyzing data over time.

- **Year to Date (YTD)**: The `DATESYTD` function returns a table containing the dates for the year to date, which can be used to calculate cumulative totals. From the beginning of the year to the current date.

    ```DAX
    Sales YTD = TOTALYTD(SUM(Sales[Amount]), 'Date'[Date])
    ```

- **Same Period Last Year (SPLY)**: The `SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR` function returns a table that contains a column of dates shifted one year back, useful for year-over-year comparisons. Compares the current period's data to the same period in the previous year.

    ```DAX
    Sales SPLY = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date]))
    ```

- **Quarter to Date (QTD)**: The `DATESQTD` function returns a table containing the dates for the quarter to date. Calculates the cumulative total from the beginning of the quarter to the current date.
    
    ```DAX
    Sales QTD = TOTALQTD(SUM(Sales[Amount]), 'Date'[Date])
    ```

- **Month to Date (MTD)**: The `DATESMTD` function returns a table containing the dates for the month to date. Calculates the cumulative total from the beginning of the month to the current date.

    ```DAX
    Sales MTD = TOTALMTD(SUM(Sales[Amount]), 'Date'[Date])
    ```
- **Custom Date Ranges**: Functions like `DATESBETWEEN` and `DATEADD` allow for custom date range calculations, providing flexibility for various time-based analyses.


### Data Modelling – Calculations

> **Calculated fields in Tableau** are the equivalent of **Calculated columns and measures in Power BI**. Power BI runs on **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** for all calculations. DAX is similar to the formulas you would write in Excel but is more powerful and flexible, allowing for complex data modeling and analysis.

#### Calculated Columns
Calculated columns are created in the data model and are computed during data refresh. They are stored in the model and can be used in slicers, filters, rows, and columns on visuals.

**Examples:**
- Creating a calculated column to sum up all values of the _Amount_ column in the _Sales_ table:

  ```DAX
  Total Sales Amount = SUM(Sales[Amount])
  ```

- Creating a new column in the Sales table called Sales Amount, where it is equal to the Quantity times the Unit Price:
  ```DAX
  Sales Amount = Sales[Quantity] * Sales[Unit Price]
  ```

#### Custom Calculations
DAX allows for custom calculations that can be tailored to specific business needs. These calculations can be simple or complex, depending on the requirements.

**Examples:**
- **Running Total**: Calculates the running total of sales.
  ```DAX
  Running Total Sales = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), FILTER(ALL('Date'), 'Date'[Date] <= MAX('Date'[Date])))
  ```

- **Percentage of Total**: Calculates the percentage of total sales for each product.
  ```DAX
  Sales Percentage = DIVIDE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), ALL(Sales)))
  ```

### Data Modelling – Measures

Measures are dynamic calculations that are computed on the fly, based on the context of the report. They are not stored in the model but are calculated as needed, making them more efficient for large datasets.

**Examples:**
- Creating a measure to calculate the total sales amount:
  ```DAX
  Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Amount])
  ```

- Creating a measure to calculate the average sales amount per transaction:
  ```DAX
  Average Sales = AVERAGE(Sales[Amount])
  ```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> - `Calculated columns` do increase your data model size because you are adding another physical column to your model. The alternative, or a better approach, is to use **Power BI measures**. You still write DAX formulas in your measures, but they don’t appear as another physical column and are calculated during run-time whenever they are referenced in your visual. <br/>
> - `Measures` can be referenced from other measures, allowing for complex calculations and aggregations.

| Calculated Columns | Measures |
|--------------------|----------|
| A new column is usually created as a function of other columns. | An aggregated value created with DAX functions. |
| Always associated with a table. | Not associated with a table. |
| Evaluated upon creation. | Evaluated when visual is built. |
| Computed at the row level of the table it's associated with. | Aggregate based on row and filter context: what is on your report page. |

#### Practical Use Cases

1. **Dynamic Calculations**: Measures are ideal for calculations that need to change based on user interactions with the report, such as filtering or slicing data.
   - **Example**: Calculating total sales for the selected region.
     ```DAX
     Total Sales by Region = SUM(Sales[Amount])
     ```

2. **Performance Optimization**: Since measures are calculated on the fly, they do not increase the size of the data model, making them more efficient for large datasets.
   - **Example**: Calculating the average sales amount without adding a new column to the data model.
     ```DAX
     Average Sales = AVERAGE(Sales[Amount])
     ```

3. **Time Intelligence**: Measures can leverage DAX's time intelligence functions to perform complex date and time calculations.
   - **Example**: Calculating year-to-date sales.
     ```DAX
     Sales YTD = TOTALYTD(SUM(Sales[Amount]), 'Date'[Date])
     ```

4. **Conditional Logic**: Measures can include conditional logic to create dynamic calculations based on specific criteria.
   - **Example**: Calculating sales amount with a discount applied if the sales amount exceeds a certain threshold.
     ```DAX
     Discounted Sales = IF(SUM(Sales[Amount]) > 1000, SUM(Sales[Amount]) * 0.9, SUM(Sales[Amount]))
     ```

5. **Referencing Other Measures**: Measures can reference other measures, allowing for layered calculations.
   - **Example**: Creating a measure for total sales and then using it in another measure to calculate the percentage of total sales.
     ```DAX
     Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Amount])
     Sales Percentage = DIVIDE([Total Sales], CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), ALL(Sales)))
     ```

  
###  Data Modelling – Conditionals

> In Power BI, you can write logical functions using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), such as **IF** and **SWITCH**. These functions allow you to create conditional logic in your data models, similar to how you would in Tableau.

#### IF Function

The `IF` function in DAX checks a condition and returns one value if the condition is TRUE, and another value if the condition is FALSE. The syntax for the IF function is:

```DAX
IF(<logical_test>, <value_if_true>[, <value_if_false>])
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `value_if_false` part is optional and can be omitted if not needed.

> **Example:**: Creating a calculated column to categorize products based on their list price. This example checks if the list price of a product is less than 500. If it is, the product is categorized as "Low"; otherwise, it is categorized as "High".

  ```DAX
  Price Group = IF('Product'[List Price] < 500, "Low", "High")
  ```

#### Nested IF Statements

You can also nest multiple IF statements to handle more complex conditions. 

> **Example:** Categorizing products into "Low", "Medium", and "High" price groups. This example first checks if the list price is less than 500. If true, it returns "Low". If false, it checks if the list price is less than 1500. If true, it returns "Medium". Otherwise, it returns "High".

  ```DAX
  Price Group = IF('Product'[List Price] < 500, "Low", 
                   IF('Product'[List Price] < 1500, "Medium", "High"))
  ```


#### SWITCH Function

The **SWITCH** function is an alternative to nested IF statements and provides a more readable way to handle multiple conditions. The syntax for the SWITCH function is:

```DAX
SWITCH(<expression>, <value1>, <result1>, <value2>, <result2>, ..., <else>)
```

> **Example:** Categorizing products based on their list price using `SWITCH`. In this example, the SWITCH function evaluates the conditions in order and returns the corresponding result for the first true condition. If none of the conditions are true, it returns the default value ("High").

  ```DAX
  Price Group = SWITCH(TRUE(),
                       'Product'[List Price] < 500, "Low",
                       'Product'[List Price] < 1500, "Medium",
                       "High")
  ```

#### Practical Use Cases
1. **Conditional Formatting**: Apply conditional formatting to visuals based on specific criteria.
   ```DAX
   Color Code = IF('Sales'[Amount] > 1000, "Green", "Red")
   ```

2. **Dynamic Titles**: Create dynamic titles for visuals based on user selections.
   ```DAX
   Title = IF(SELECTEDVALUE('Date'[Year]) = 2025, "Current Year Sales", "Historical Sales")
   ```

3. **Custom Aggregations**: Perform custom aggregations based on conditions.
   ```DAX
   Custom Total = IF('Sales'[Region] = "North", SUM('Sales'[Amount]), 0)
   ```
### Data Modelling – Star Schemas

Star Schemas are a way to organize your data, where there is one fact table that contains the transactional data, and smaller dimension tables that contain characteristics. The fact table and dimension tables are connected through one-to-many relationships via unique keys. This approach helps avoid data duplication by storing only the key in your fact table.

> The diagram illustrates the relationships between a central fact table ("Sales") and its surrounding dimension tables ("Product," "Sales Territory," "Employee," "Reseller," and "Date").

<p align="center">
  <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1842372a-72f4-4b7d-8abd-48c524c97cb7">
</p>

#### Key Components of a Star Schema

1. **Fact Table**:
   - **Definition**: The central table in a star schema that contains quantitative data (measures) and foreign keys to dimension tables.
   - **Example**: A Sales fact table might include columns like `SalesID`, `DateKey`, `ProductKey`, `CustomerKey`, `SalesAmount`, and `Quantity`.
   - **Characteristics**: Fact tables typically have a large number of rows and grow over time as new transactions are recorded.

2. **Dimension Tables**:
   - **Definition**: Smaller tables that contain descriptive attributes (dimensions) related to the measures in the fact table.
   - **Example**: A Product dimension table might include columns like `ProductKey`, `ProductName`, `Category`, and `Price`.
   - **Characteristics**: Dimension tables usually have fewer rows compared to fact tables and contain attributes that describe the entities in the fact table.

3. **Relationships**:
   - **Definition**: One-to-many relationships between the fact table and dimension tables, established through unique keys.
   - **Example**: The `ProductKey` in the Sales fact table relates to the `ProductKey` in the Product dimension table, creating a one-to-many relationship.

#### Benefits of Using Star Schemas

> By designing a star schema for your dataset in Power BI, you can optimize performance and usability, especially when filtering and aggregating data. This approach is more efficient than storing all your data as flat files, which can lead to high data redundancy and slower performance.


1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - **Efficient Queries**: Star schemas simplify complex queries by reducing the number of joins needed, leading to faster query performance.
   - **Indexing**: Fact and dimension tables can be indexed separately, improving data retrieval speed.

2. **Data Redundancy Reduction**:
   - **Avoid Duplication**: By storing only the keys in the fact table, star schemas minimize data redundancy and reduce storage requirements.

3. **Improved Usability**:
   - **Simplified Data Model**: Star schemas provide a clear and intuitive data model that is easier to understand and navigate.
   - **Enhanced Filtering**: Dimension tables allow for more efficient filtering and grouping of data, improving the user experience when interacting with reports and dashboards.

#### Practical Example in Power BI

Consider a retail business that wants to analyze sales data. The star schema for this scenario might include the following tables:

- **Fact Table**: `Sales`
  - Columns: `SalesID`, `DateKey`, `ProductKey`, `CustomerKey`, `StoreKey`, `SalesAmount`, `Quantity`
- **Dimension Tables**:
  - **Date**: `DateKey`, `Date`, `Month`, `Quarter`, `Year`
  - **Product**: `ProductKey`, `ProductName`, `Category`, `Price`
  - **Customer**: `CustomerKey`, `CustomerName`, `Region`, `Segment`
  - **Store**: `StoreKey`, `StoreName`, `Location`, `Manager`

In Power BI, you would create relationships between the `Sales` fact table and each dimension table using the unique keys (e.g., `DateKey`, `ProductKey`). This setup allows you to perform detailed analysis and reporting, such as:

- **Total Sales by Product Category**:
  ```DAX
  Total Sales = SUM(Sales[SalesAmount])
  ```

- **Sales Trend Over Time**:
  ```DAX
  Sales YTD = TOTALYTD(SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]), 'Date'[Date])
  ```

- **Customer Segmentation Analysis**:
  ```DAX
  Sales by Segment = SUM(Sales[SalesAmount])
  ```

## How to create visualizations 

> `Think Dashboards`: In Power BI, you can create dashboards that combine multiple visuals on a single page. This allows you to tell a comprehensive data story by displaying related visuals together. For example, you can have a bar chart, line graph, and pie chart all on one page, and they can interact with each other. `When you select a data point in one visual, it can filter or highlight related data in the other visuals, providing a more dynamic and interactive experience.`

### Recreate Simple Visuals
When migrating from Tableau to Power BI, you can use Power BI's features to recreate your existing visuals. Power BI has similar functionalities to Tableau's `Show Me`, `Rows/Columns Shelf`, and `Marks Card`. You can drag and drop fields to create visuals, customize them with different chart types, and apply filters and formatting to match your original designs.

| Functionality | Tableau | Power Bi |

### Explore Custom Visuals
If Power BI's built-in visuals don't meet your needs, you can explore the extensive library of custom visuals available in the Power BI marketplace. These custom visuals are created by the community and third-party developers, offering a wide range of options to enhance your reports. You can find visuals for advanced charts, maps, and other specialized visualizations that might not be available out-of-the-box.

### Learn New Tools
Power BI offers several unique tools that can enhance your visualizations. For example:
- **Bookmarks:** Bookmarks allow you to capture the current state of a report page, including filters, slicers, and visual settings. You can use bookmarks to create interactive reports with different views and navigation options.
- **Drillthrough:** This feature lets you create detailed drillthrough pages that provide more in-depth information about a specific data point. Users can right-click on a data point and navigate to a detailed report page focused on that data.
- **Tooltips:** Custom tooltips can be designed to show additional information when users hover over a data point. This can include charts, images, and text to provide more context without cluttering the main visual.

### Parameters 

> `Parameters` in Power BI are versatile tools that allow you to add interactivity and flexibility to your reports. They can be used to create dynamic filters, control visual elements, and enable users to interact with the data in meaningful ways. Here’s a more detailed look at how you can use parameters in Power BI:

#### Types of Parameters

1. **Numeric Parameters**: These allow you to create parameters with numeric values. For example, you can create a parameter to adjust a discount rate or a threshold value. Users can interact with these parameters using sliders or input boxes to see how changes in the parameter affect the data.
2. **Field Parameters**: These parameters allow you to switch between different fields or dimensions in your data. For example, you can create a parameter to toggle between different metrics like sales, profit, or quantity, allowing users to dynamically change the visualized data.

#### Creating and Using Parameters

1. **Creating a Numeric Parameter**:
   - Go to the `Modeling` tab in Power BI Desktop.
   - Select `New Parameter` and choose `Numeric Range`.
   - Configure the parameter by setting its name, data type, minimum and maximum values, and increment steps.
   - Once created, the parameter can be added to your report as a slicer, allowing users to adjust its value interactively.
2. **Creating a Field Parameter**:
   - Similar to numeric parameters, you can create field parameters by selecting `New Parameter` and choosing `Fields`.
   - Define the fields you want to include in the parameter.
   - Users can then switch between these fields in the report, providing a dynamic way to explore different dimensions of the data.

#### Using Parameters in Calculations: 

In Power BI, parameters can be referenced in DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) calculations to create dynamic measures and calculated columns. For example, you can create a measure that adjusts based on the value of a numeric parameter. For example, this measure will dynamically update based on the value selected in the discount parameter, allowing users to see the impact of different discount rates on sales.

```DAX
SalesAfterDiscount = SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]) - (SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]) * 'Discount Parameter'[Discount Value])
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **Single Value Parameters**: Unlike Tableau, Power BI does not support single value parameters directly. However, you can achieve similar functionality using measures. For instance, you can create a measure that holds a single value and use it in your calculations. <br/>
> - **Dynamic Filtering**: Parameters can be used to create dynamic filters that adjust the data displayed in visuals. This is particularly useful for creating interactive reports where users can explore different scenarios and what-if analyses. 

#### Practical Applications: 

1. **Scenario Analysis**: Use parameters to create what-if scenarios, such as adjusting sales targets or budget allocations, and see how these changes impact your key metrics.
2. **Dynamic Reporting**: Allow users to switch between different metrics or dimensions, providing a more flexible and interactive reporting experience.
3. **Customizable Visuals**: Enable users to customize visuals by selecting different parameters, such as changing the time period, geographic region, or product category.

### Bookmarks 

> `Bookmarks` in Power BI are powerful tools that allow you to capture and save the current state of a report page, including filters, slicers, sort order, and the visibility of visuals. This feature is similar to **Tableau** actions and the concept of parameterizing sheets, enabling users to switch between different views or states within a report.

#### Key Features and Uses of Bookmarks

1. **Navigation and Interactivity**:
   - **Navigation**: Bookmarks can be used to create a navigation experience within your report. By linking bookmarks to buttons or images, you can guide users through different sections or pages of your report, creating an app-like experience.
   - **Interactivity**: Bookmarks allow users to toggle between different states of a report. For example, you can create bookmarks to switch between different visualizations, such as a bar chart and a line graph, or to show and hide specific visuals based on user interaction.
2. **Swapping Visuals**: One of the most common uses of bookmarks is to swap out visuals in a report. This can be particularly useful when you want to provide different perspectives on the same data. For instance, you can create bookmarks to switch between a detailed view and a summary view of your data, or to compare different metrics side by side.
3. **Capturing Report States**: Bookmarks capture the entire state of a report page, including the current filters, slicers, and visual settings. This means you can create bookmarks for different scenarios or analysis points, allowing users to quickly switch between them without having to manually adjust filters or settings each time.
4. **Creating Interactive Reports**: By using bookmarks in combination with buttons, you can create highly interactive reports. For example, you can set up buttons to apply specific filters, reset filters, or navigate to different report pages. This enhances the user experience by making the report more dynamic and user-friendly.

#### How to Create and Use Bookmarks

1. **Creating a Bookmark**:
   - In Power BI Desktop, go to the **View** tab and enable the **Bookmarks Pane**.
   - Configure your report page as you want it to appear in the bookmark (e.g., apply filters, adjust visuals).
   - In the Bookmarks Pane, click **Add** to create a new bookmark. You can rename the bookmark for easy reference.
2. **Using Bookmarks with Buttons**:
   - You can assign bookmarks to buttons or images to create interactive elements in your report.
   - In the **Insert** tab, add a button or image to your report.
   - In the **Format** pane, go to the **Action** settings, enable **Action**, and select **Bookmark**. Choose the bookmark you want to link to the button.
3. **Managing Bookmarks**: You can update, rename, delete, and reorder bookmarks in the Bookmarks Pane. This allows you to keep your bookmarks organized and make adjustments as needed.
4. **Advanced Bookmark Features**:
   - **Grouping Bookmarks**: You can group bookmarks to create a sequence of views or steps. This is useful for presentations or guided analysis.
   - **Data, Display, and Current Page Options**: When creating or updating a bookmark, you can choose which aspects of the report state to capture (e.g., data filters, visual display settings, or the current page).

#### Practical Applications

1. **Storytelling**: Use bookmarks to create a narrative flow in your report, guiding users through different insights and analysis points.
2. **Interactive Dashboards**: Enhance dashboards with interactive elements that allow users to switch views, apply filters, and navigate between pages seamlessly.
3. **Scenario Analysis**: Create bookmarks for different scenarios or what-if analyses, enabling users to explore various outcomes and impacts.
