----------

Data Virtualization can be leveraged either through a dedicated tool or an integrated approach:

> `Dedicated Tool`: Traditional data virtualization tools (e.g., Denodo, Informatica, etc) are specifically designed for data virtualization. <br/>
> `Integrated Approach`: Microsoft Fabric provides data virtualization capabilities by integrating a range of services, each specializing in areas such as data integration (Azure Data Factory), storage (Data Lake Storage), querying (Azure Synapse Analytics), and visualization (Power Bi).

> Considerations: <br/>
> - **Scalability**: Ensure your ingestion process can handle varying data volumes and can scale up or down as needed. <br/>
> - **Latency**: Consider the acceptable latency for your use case. Real-time ingestion requires low latency, while batch ingestion can tolerate higher latency. <br/>
> - **Data Quality**: Implement data validation and cleansing during the ingestion process to ensure the quality of the ingested data. <br/>
> - **Security**: Secure data in transit and at rest using encryption and access control mechanisms.

### Data Ingestion

**Data ingestion** is the process of `collecting and importing data` from various sources into a centralized storage system, such as a data warehouse or data lake. This process involves several steps and can be performed using different tools and techniques depending on the source and type of data.

#### Key Components of Data Ingestion

1. **Data Sources**:
   - **Structured Data**: Data from relational databases, CSV files, spreadsheets, etc.
   - **Semi-Structured Data**: Data from JSON, XML files, etc.
   - **Unstructured Data**: Data from text files, images, videos, etc.
   - **Streaming Data**: Real-time data from IoT devices, logs, social media feeds, etc.
2. **Ingestion Methods**:
   - **Batch Ingestion**: Collecting and processing data in large chunks at scheduled intervals. Suitable for scenarios where real-time processing is not required.
   - **Real-Time Ingestion**: Continuously collecting and processing data as it arrives. Suitable for scenarios requiring immediate data processing and analysis.
3. **Ingestion Tools**:
   - **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: A cloud-based data integration service that allows you to create, schedule, and orchestrate data pipelines. It supports a wide range of data sources and destinations.
   - **Azure Stream Analytics**: A real-time analytics service designed to process and analyze streaming data from various sources.
   - **Azure Event Hubs**: A big data streaming platform and event ingestion service capable of receiving and processing millions of events per second.
   - **Azure IoT Hub**: A managed service that enables bi-directional communication between IoT applications and the devices it manages.

#### Examples of Data Ingestion

### Step 3: Query and Analyze Data

1. To generate reports, we need to build tables from the CSV files to create the semantic model. We can achieve this either through the shortcut or by using the extracted information. In this scenario, let's assume the shortcut represents the gold layer, meaning all the data in CSV format is ready for use. I will proceed to load that information into tables.

   <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b782db1-e2c1-411a-9412-0b65e0b2119b" />

   <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c628ef5-15a0-4de9-b717-f2139df8fa3a" />

   <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6271e569-ed04-4c67-a332-d2d7ad614fe4">

    > At this point, you will find the following objects in your workspace:
    
    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c213242b-2cda-4ecc-92dd-1b3acdf153ea" />

2. **Create Interactive Reports with Power BI**:
   - To create interactive dashboards and reports for data visualization, connect Power BI to your semantic model. Click on `...` on your semantic model.

       <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdc1de90-1d9a-4021-9c47-1eacae2fe2a0" />
   
   - We can leverage `Copilot` capabilities to automatically generate a report based on our semantic model and further edit it.
