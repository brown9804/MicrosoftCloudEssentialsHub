## Secure Data Extraction

Some key aspects:

1. Authentication and Access Control
    - **Microsoft Entra ID**: All interactions with Fabric are authenticated using Microsoft Entra ID, ensuring secure access from any device and network.
    - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access to data is managed based on user roles, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data.
2. Data Encryption
    - **Data in Transit**: All data transferred within Fabric is encrypted by default, protecting it from interception during extraction.
    - **Data at Rest**: Data stored in Fabric is automatically encrypted, ensuring it remains secure even when not in use.
3. Network Security
    - **Private Links and Conditional Access**: Fabric can use private links and conditional access policies to regulate and secure data access, especially for data behind firewalls or within private networks.
    - **Trusted Access**: Fabric can securely connect to data sources protected by firewalls or private networks, ensuring data is not exposed to the public internet.
4. Compliance and Governance
    - **Compliance Standards**: Fabric supports a wide range of compliance standards, ensuring data security and regulatory compliance.
    - **Governance Tools**: Features like data lineage, information protection labels, and data loss prevention help manage and secure data throughout its lifecycle.
5. Automation and Monitoring
    - **Automated Security Protocols**: Security protocols, including access controls and encryption, are automated to reduce human error and ensure consistent application.
    - **Threat Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for vulnerabilities and threats helps maintain a secure environment.
