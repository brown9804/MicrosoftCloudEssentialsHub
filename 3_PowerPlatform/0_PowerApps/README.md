- **Business Logic and Workflow Capabilities**: Apps built using Power Apps provide rich business logic and workflow capabilities to transform your manual business operations into digital, automated processes.
- **Responsive Design**: Apps built using Power Apps have a responsive design and can run seamlessly in a browser and on mobile devices (phone or tablet).
- **No Code Required**: Power Apps "democratizes" the business-app-building experience by enabling users to create feature-rich, custom business apps `without writing code`.
- **Extensible Platform**: Power Apps also provides an extensible platform that lets pro developers programmatically interact with data and metadata, apply business logic, create custom connectors, and integrate with external data.

## Power Apps for Different Users
