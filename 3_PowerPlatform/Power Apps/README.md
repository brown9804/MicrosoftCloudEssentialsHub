------------------------------------------

Microsoft Power Apps is a suite of apps, services, and connectors, as well as a data platform. It provides a rapid development environment to build custom apps for your business needs. <br/>

`Using Power Apps, you can create three types of apps: canvas, model-driven, and portal.`

## Key Features
- **Rapid Application Development**: Power Apps allows you to quickly build custom business apps that connect to your data stored either in the underlying data platform (Microsoft Dataverse) or in various online and on-premises data sources.
- **Business Logic and Workflow Capabilities**: Apps built using Power Apps provide rich business logic and workflow capabilities to transform your manual business operations into digital, automated processes.
- **Responsive Design**: Apps built using Power Apps have a responsive design and can run seamlessly in a browser and on mobile devices (phone or tablet).
- **No Code Required**: Power Apps "democratizes" the business-app-building experience by enabling users to create feature-rich, custom business apps `without writing code`.
- **Extensible Platform**: Power Apps also provides an extensible platform that lets pro developers programmatically interact with data and metadata, apply business logic, create custom connectors, and integrate with external data.

## Power Apps for Different Users
- **App Makers/Creators**: Power Apps Studio is the app designer used for building canvas apps.
- **App Users**: You can run apps that you created, or that someone else created and shared with you, in a browser or on mobile devices.
- **Admins**: Power Apps administrators can use the Power Platform admin center to create and manage environments, view Dataverse analytics, and get real-time, self-help recommendations and support for Power Apps and Power Automate.
- **Developers**: Developers are app makers who can write code to extend business app creation and customization.
