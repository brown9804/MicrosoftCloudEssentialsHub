## Demo 

### Topic 1: Configure your your environment and Create a Copilot

- Go to [Microsoft Copilot Studio Home Page](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com/)
- Prompt your case, for example:

  ```text
  I'm planning to develop a support copilot for our Contoso customers. This tool will assist by providing answers to frequently asked questions and performing routine tasks, such as order status updates.
  ```

  <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db23a02f-6000-43b7-8617-af4504faa040">

- Setup your Copilot Name, Icon, description and instructions:

  <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2197193b-d91e-4a2a-8078-251441c06e3a">

  ```
  - Information should come from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/ and from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/
  - Maintain a professional, cheerful tone focused on our clients, avoiding any mention of competitors or comparisons with their products.
  ```

### Topic 2: Understanding Entities & Slot Filling

| Concept       | Description                                                                 | Example                                                                                   |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Entities**  | Key pieces of information that the AI copilot needs to understand and extract from user inputs. | - **Examples**: Names, dates, locations, product names, quantities. <br> - **Usage**: "Book a flight to New York for tomorrow" (Entities: "New York" - location, "tomorrow" - date). |
| **Slot Filling** | The process of collecting all necessary entities (or slots) required to complete a task. The AI copilot asks follow-up questions to gather any missing information. | - **Example**: For booking a flight, the copilot might need the departure city, destination city, date, and time. If the user only provides the destination, the copilot will ask for the remaining details. <br> - **Scenario**: Booking a meeting room. <br> **Entities**: Date, time, room number, duration. <br> **User Input**: "I need a room for a meeting tomorrow." <br> **Slot Filling**: <br> - Copilot: "What time is the meeting?" <br> - User: "At 3 PM." <br> - Copilot: "How long will the meeting last?" <br> - User: "2 hours." <br> - Copilot: "Which room would you like to book?" <br> - User: "Room 101." |

- Go to `Settings` in top-right corner, and select `Entities`. Then select `Add` an entity and `New entity`.

  <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b543c6ff-ac7c-4b6b-9268-d9bacd301a02">

- You can choose between `Closed list` or `Regular expression (Regex)`:

  <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9171775c-140b-4a2c-b344-a1bbda1f46c1">

  > If you choose `Closed list` you will se a window like this:

  <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/562c8b59-6f42-46ab-b634-9209f695ea71">

- You can add that `Entity` to the `Topic`:

  <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfd4ce79-59c4-4bbf-86e5-62a776dcaa5c">


  <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53155f54-de30-462a-a0c8-3cae98d05758">
